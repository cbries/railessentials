## RailwayEssential

RailwayEssential is a software for controlling your Model Trains especially when [ESU's ECoS 50210/50200](http://www.esu.eu/en/products/digital-control/ecos-50210-dcc-system/what-ecos-can-do/) is used. RailwayEssential provides a Track-designer, an Analyzer for automatic detection of all possible Routes between directly connected Blocks, and an Event-system (e.g. by use of S88-Feedback-Bus) for setup a fully automatic drive of all your trains. Furthermore, any Train can be manually controlled, their functions are allowed to be switched directly on and off by the user interface.
